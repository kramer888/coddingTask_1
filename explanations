1. I used knockout.js for the data binding.
There's no particular reason that I chose that lib (I could have just as well use Angular, Ember etc')

2. The workflow starts by getting the info from the server (the JSON data), and then populating the dropdown list with
all the relevant options, which are the "bug status" options i.e. new, open, resolved etc'

3. When the user choses an 'status option' from the drop down list, 
I populate a table with the relevant transitions for that status.

4. Each data entity i.e. 'status', 'transition' and 'position' is related to each other so I could have used one single object
which would hold all the interrelated data but I prefered to seperate it
and created a "hash" for the positions and for the transitions for easy access for when I need to get a value (like a dictionary).


NOTE: I didn't get what's the meaning of the 'top' and 'left' properties.
I sent a question but I was told that's part of the test.
If I don't know what's the meaning of a property, I can't use it and.
The property "top" could mean
